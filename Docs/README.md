This is the place where all things related to the documentation and support of the project should go. This includes, but is not limited to:

<ol>
    <li>External articles, papers, videos, etc relevant to the project</li>
    <li>Schematics, rough drawings, and image prototypes</li>
    <li>Configuration and installation tutorials (when we get there)</li>
</ol>

If some article of documentation seems like a "new" category, feel free to create a new directory within this folder
